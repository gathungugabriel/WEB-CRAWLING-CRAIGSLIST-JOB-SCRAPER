Design Gig - Help Needed - Set of Illustrations - Remote and In-Person,"QR Code Link to This Post


Hello! I am starting a new company and brand. While we will have multiple products across our category, we will have a unique 'collection' of hats that feature embroidered patches. (Best parallel is Goorin Bros. and their Animal Farm collection.)

To date, I have created a mood board on Figma and scoped out the sixteen designs/patches that are needed. (Of note, I hired a remote illustrator via UpWork and we managed to make four of the designs, but they are not quite right and need fixing. This is where you hopefully come in! I need help with the 'repair' of the four initial designs and the creation of twelve new ones.)

For context on the end product, each cap/hat will have a beautiful patch on the front, approximately 3.375 inches wide by 2.125 inches high. The key challenge is finding the proper 'visual vibe' and making sure there is unity across the illustrations/patches in the collection.

IMPORTANT:
Most of the work can be done remotely on your time and at your convenience...
But, I believe we will need to meet in person at least a couple times at minimum (e.g., a kickoff and a final edit). I am based in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. If in NYC, I can come to you. I am also happy to have you meet me in my condo's business center.

For this gig, please include in your reply...

Production Assistant,"QR Code Link to This Post


My company makes decorative light switch covers.  Attached are examples.

Making each one involves cutting a photograph to the correct size, gluing it onto a plastic frame, cutting out die holes, and putting it into a plastic bag with two screws. The work is simple but requires precision.

I've been selling these for the last two years and producing them by hand. Now, due to my worsening arthritis, I can't produce the pieces any more. I'm looking for a reliable someone with a steady hand and a commitment to quality that I can hire to fill orders as they come. I will supply all the materials.  You will work from your home or studio.  Completing each piece takes about 20 minutes.  I will pay you $5.00 per piece.  If you're interested in knowing more, please contact me here.

Design Gig - Help Needed - Set of Illustrations - Remote and In-Person,"QR Code Link to This Post


Hello! I am starting a new company and brand. While we will have multiple products across our category, we will have a unique 'collection' of hats that feature embroidered patches. (Best parallel is Goorin Bros. and their Animal Farm collection.)

To date, I have created a mood board on Figma and scoped out the sixteen designs/patches that are needed. (Of note, I hired a remote illustrator via UpWork and we managed to make four of the designs, but they are not quite right and need fixing. This is where you hopefully come in! I need help with the 'repair' of the four initial designs and the creation of twelve new ones.)

For context on the end product, each cap/hat will have a beautiful patch on the front, approximately 3.375 inches wide by 2.125 inches high. The key challenge is finding the proper 'visual vibe' and making sure there is unity across the illustrations/patches in the collection.

IMPORTANT:
Most of the work can be done remotely on your time and at your convenience...
But, I believe we will need to meet in person at least a couple times at minimum (e.g., a kickoff and a final edit). I am based in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. If in NYC, I can come to you. I am also happy to have you meet me in my condo's business center.

For this gig, please include in your reply...

Production Assistant,"QR Code Link to This Post


My company makes decorative light switch covers.  Attached are examples.

Making each one involves cutting a photograph to the correct size, gluing it onto a plastic frame, cutting out die holes, and putting it into a plastic bag with two screws. The work is simple but requires precision.

I've been selling these for the last two years and producing them by hand. Now, due to my worsening arthritis, I can't produce the pieces any more. I'm looking for a reliable someone with a steady hand and a commitment to quality that I can hire to fill orders as they come. I will supply all the materials.  You will work from your home or studio.  Completing each piece takes about 20 minutes.  I will pay you $5.00 per piece.  If you're interested in knowing more, please contact me here.

Design Gig - Help Needed - Set of Illustrations - Remote and In-Person,"QR Code Link to This Post


Hello! I am starting a new company and brand. While we will have multiple products across our category, we will have a unique 'collection' of hats that feature embroidered patches. (Best parallel is Goorin Bros. and their Animal Farm collection.)

To date, I have created a mood board on Figma and scoped out the sixteen designs/patches that are needed. (Of note, I hired a remote illustrator via UpWork and we managed to make four of the designs, but they are not quite right and need fixing. This is where you hopefully come in! I need help with the 'repair' of the four initial designs and the creation of twelve new ones.)

For context on the end product, each cap/hat will have a beautiful patch on the front, approximately 3.375 inches wide by 2.125 inches high. The key challenge is finding the proper 'visual vibe' and making sure there is unity across the illustrations/patches in the collection.

IMPORTANT:
Most of the work can be done remotely on your time and at your convenience...
But, I believe we will need to meet in person at least a couple times at minimum (e.g., a kickoff and a final edit). I am based in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. If in NYC, I can come to you. I am also happy to have you meet me in my condo's business center.

For this gig, please include in your reply...

Design Gig - Help Needed - Set of Illustrations - Remote and In-Person,"QR Code Link to This Post


Hello! I am starting a new company and brand. While we will have multiple products across our category, we will have a unique 'collection' of hats that feature embroidered patches. (Best parallel is Goorin Bros. and their Animal Farm collection.)

To date, I have created a mood board on Figma and scoped out the sixteen designs/patches that are needed. (Of note, I hired a remote illustrator via UpWork and we managed to make four of the designs, but they are not quite right and need fixing. This is where you hopefully come in! I need help with the 'repair' of the four initial designs and the creation of twelve new ones.)

For context on the end product, each cap/hat will have a beautiful patch on the front, approximately 3.375 inches wide by 2.125 inches high. The key challenge is finding the proper 'visual vibe' and making sure there is unity across the illustrations/patches in the collection.

IMPORTANT:
Most of the work can be done remotely on your time and at your convenience...
But, I believe we will need to meet in person at least a couple times at minimum (e.g., a kickoff and a final edit). I am based in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. If in NYC, I can come to you. I am also happy to have you meet me in my condo's business center.

For this gig, please include in your reply...
